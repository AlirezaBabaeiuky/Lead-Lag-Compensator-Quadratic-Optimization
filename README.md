# Lead-Lag-Compensator-Quadratic-Optimization
This repository includes Lead Compensator, Lag Compensator, and Lag-Lead Compensator designs to address: Stability Margin (Angle Deficiency), Steady-State Accuracy, and overall performance of an Electric Motor. 
Optimum solution of different compensators is selected via: Quadratic Optimization and Performance Index.

Compensators in control engineering realm are physical elemtns/devices with electronic boards whic mathematically encompass zeros and poles. Multiplying the plant transfer function with such zeros and poles alters the system dynamics and responses. So, compensators can be used to 
loop-shaping (re-shape) the system responses in Bode and Nyquist, Step ... .  
Loop Shaping is a more general technique in controls engineering to add filters (which are again zeros and poles) to the open-loop transfer function to modify system response so that the Dominant Closed-Loop Poles are located the Desired locations in Comple xFrequency (S - Laplace variable) domain. This process is called: Loop-Shaping, Filter Design, Lag/Lead Compensator Design, Pole-Placement (in modern controls), ...
